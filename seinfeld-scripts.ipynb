To be out, \\n               this is out...and out is one of the \\n               single most enjoyable experiences of \\n               life. People...did you ever hear people \\n               talking about \"We should go out\"? This \\n               is what they\\'re talking about...this \\n               whole thing, we\\'re all out now, no one \\n               is home. Not one person here is home, \\n               we\\'re all out! There are people tryin\\' \\n               to find us, they don\\'t know where we \\n               are. (imitates one of these people \"tryin\\' \\n               to find us\"; pretends his hand is a \\n               phone) \"Did you ring?, I can\\'t find \\n               him.\" (imitates other person on phone) \\n               \"Where did he go?\" (the first person \\n               again) \"He didn\\'t tell me where he was \\n               going\". He must have gone out. You wanna \\n               go out: you get ready, you pick out \\n               the clothes, right? You take the shower, \\n               you get all ready, get the cash, get \\n               your friends, the car, the spot, the \\n               reservation...There you\\'re staring around, \\n               whatta you do? You go: \"We gotta be \\n               getting back\". Once you\\'re out, you \\n               wanna get back! You wanna go to sleep, \\n               you wanna get up, you wanna go out again \\n               tomorrow, right? Where ever you are \\n               in life, it\\'s my feeling, you\\'ve gotta \\n               go.\\n<b> \\n</b><b>               \\n</b><b>               \\n</b><b>               \\n</b>               (Pete\\'s luncheonette.
